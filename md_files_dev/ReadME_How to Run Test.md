# 🚀 Solana vs Ethereum: Smart Contract Developer Cheat Sheet

This cheat sheet highlights Solana’s unique architecture **vs Ethereum**, and how to **leverage it while writing smart contracts**. Tailored for practical usage in Solana programs.

---

### 1. Proof of History (PoH)  
🔸 *What it gives you:* Fast and deterministic ordering of transactions.  
✅ *What to do:*  
- Use Solana’s ledger order directly — no manual ordering logic needed.  
  `<<<<vs ETH where you must manually verify ordering or protect against timestamp manipulation>>>>`  
- For time-based logic, use the `Clock` sysvar (slot/epoch).  
  `<<<<vs ETH where block.timestamp is miner-controlled and potentially inaccurate>>>>`

---

### 2. Tower BFT (Fast Finality)  
🔸 *What it gives you:* ~1–2 second finality.  
✅ *What to do:*  
- Build real-time systems: games, auctions, liquidations.  
  `<<<<vs ETH where finality is slower (12–30s) and subject to reorgs>>>>`

---

### 3. Gulf Stream (No Mempool Waiting)  
🔸 *What it gives you:* Pre-forwarded txs → faster execution, lower MEV risk.  
✅ *What to do:*  
- No need for commit-reveal tricks or Flashbots.  
  `<<<<vs ETH where transactions sit in public mempool and are vulnerable to MEV attacks>>>>`

---

### 4. Turbine (Efficient Block Propagation)  
🔸 *What it gives you:* Fast, chunked propagation of blocks across nodes.  
✅ *What to do:*  
- Use **multiple small transactions** instead of batching.  
  `<<<<vs ETH where block limits and propagation time discourage many txs>>>>`

---

### 5. Sealevel (Parallel Execution)  
🔸 *What it gives you:* Concurrent tx processing if accounts don’t overlap.  
✅ *What to do:*  
- Store per-user data in separate PDAs.  
  `<<<<vs ETH where all txs are serial and one slow user blocks everyone>>>>`  
- Avoid shared global state.

---

### 6. Pipelining  
🔸 *What it gives you:* Parallelized processing stages (fetch → verify → execute).  
✅ *What to do:*  
- Keep contracts short and clean.  
  `<<<<vs ETH where you can write long monolithic contracts (but gas costs spike)>>>>`

---

### 7. Cloudbreak (Account Storage Engine)  
🔸 *What it gives you:* Fast, concurrent account access.  
✅ *What to do:*  
- Avoid bloated data inside a single account.  
  `<<<<vs ETH where mappings are cheap structurally, but gas-heavy to grow>>>>`  
- Use many accounts with granular scope (per user, per asset).

---

### 8. Archivers (Decentralized Storage)  
🔸 *What it gives you:* Off-chain storage + verifiability.  
✅ *What to do:*  
- Store large or historical data off-chain (Arweave/IPFS) and link via hashes.  
  `<<<<vs ETH where all logs and state are stored on-chain and expensive>>>>`

---

### 9. Stateless Smart Contracts  
🔸 *What it gives you:* Programs don’t store internal state; all state is in accounts.  
✅ *What to do:*  
- Treat contracts like **pure functions** with account input/output.  
  `<<<<vs ETH where contracts store state internally and hidden side-effects can occur>>>>`

---

### 10. Low Fees + Compute-Based Metering  
🔸 *What it gives you:* Low SOL-based fees, enforced by compute unit limits.  
✅ *What to do:*  
- Break workflows into multiple cheap transactions.  
  `<<<<vs ETH where devs cram logic into one tx to save on high gas>>>>`  
- Monitor CU usage with `solana logs` and budget wisely.

## ✅ Best Practices Summary

| Strategy                          | Do This (Solana)                       | Not This (Ethereum-style)                 |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Store user data                  | In separate PDAs                       | In a shared mapping                       |
| Use time                         | `Clock` sysvar (slot/epoch)            | `block.timestamp`                         |
| Design contract logic            | Stateless, functional, modular         | Stateful, monolithic                      |
| Handle scaling                   | Leverage Sealevel + Turbine            | Serial tx model, scaling is hard          |
| Handle data growth               | Many accounts (Cloudbreak)             | Contract storage growth = gas spikes      |
| Optimize fees                    | Break into multiple low-CU txs         | One big tx due to high gas                |
| Prevent MEV/front-running        | Built-in via Gulf Stream               | Requires Flashbots, commit-reveal         |
| Store historical data            | Off-chain (with hashes on-chain)       | Expensive on-chain logs and events        |
